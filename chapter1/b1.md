\(B1\) Consider the following problem in undergraduate classes.

Suppose$$x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n$$ are i.i.d. with certain distribution F in which the \(population\) mean/expectation is denoted by Âµ and the \(population\) variance is denoted by $$\sigma^2 , 0<\sigma^2<\infty$$.

To test the null hypothesis:$$\quad H_0 : \mu\le0, vs
\quad H_a : \mu> 0 \quad,(5)$$
