\(B1\) Consider the following problem in undergraduate classes.

Suppose$$x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n$$ are i.i.d. with certain distribution F in which the \(population\) mean/expectation is denoted by µ and the \(population\) variance is denoted by $$\sigma^2 , 0<\sigma^2<\infty$$.

To test the null hypothesis:$$\quad H_0 : \mu\le0, vs
\quad H_a : \mu> 0 \quad \tag{5}$$

As usual, we use the following so-called ”t-statistic”:

$$\displaystyle \bar{x}\sqrt{n}/{\mathcal{s}}\tag{6}$$

where $$\;\; \bar{x} =\displaystyle\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^nX_t \;\;$$ , and $$\;\; s^2 =\displaystyle\frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{t=1}^n(x_t- \bar{x})^2$$ ,

that is, the sample mean and the sample variance respectively.

Figure out the critical value of the so-called ”t-statistic” in \(6\) under the following cases:

\(a\) F is normal and n is small.

\(b\) F is normal and n is large.
